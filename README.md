# Food Junkies

## User Story
As a food enthusiast,
I want to be able to search for restaurant and dish recommendations, 
so that I can try new foods when I am in a particular city.

## Description
This is a full stack web application that allows users to recommend restaurants and dishes by a particular city.  Users must be logged in to their account to use this application.  Once logged in, they have access to view all recommendations/posts by city or to to post a new recommendation of their own.

## Technologies Used
- HTML (created using Handlebars templates)
- CSS (created using Bootstrap)
- Javascript
- Node.js & Express.js (for the API)
- MySQL & Sequelize ORM (for the database)
- Heroku (to deploy) 

## New Technology Used - Multer
Attempting to incorporate Multer module into our application to upload user photos, we referenced the following Multer Tutorial/Sample project:
https://github.com/bezkoder/nodejs-upload-image-mysql.git

***All of the original code we referenced to get the photo uploader to work in our application is included (commented out, with references) in our code***
